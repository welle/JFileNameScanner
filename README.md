## Quick summary ##

Based on the file name, the Java library can:

* For a movie: extract the name and year.
* For a TV series: retrieve the name and number of the episode and the number of the season.

## How to use it ##

In the classes *_JUnitTest you'll find comprehensive examples of how to use it.

### Version

Go to [my maven repository](https://github.com/welle/maven-repository) to get the latest version.

## Notes
Need the eclipse-external-annotations-m2e-plugin: 

p2 update site to install this from: http://www.lastnpe.org/eclipse-external-annotations-m2e-plugin-p2-site/ (The 404 is normal, just because there is no index.html; it will work in Eclipse.)
